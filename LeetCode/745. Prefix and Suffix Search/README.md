Problem located at https://leetcode.com/problems/prefix-and-suffix-search/

Notes:
Did not create an entire project as rust can be run remotely from leetcode.
There are many different types of solutions, but Trie runs very efficiently due to number of letters being limited to 10.
Essentially the same code as [this solution.](https://leetcode.com/problems/prefix-and-suffix-search/discuss/144432/Java-Beat-95-just-small-modifications-in-implementing-Trie.)
Definitely a better way to code in Rust, but still making progress :)
