Problem located at https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/

Notes:
Did not create an entire project as rust can be run remotely from leetcode.

A very easy solution is to just sort the entire list or use a priority queue, but I saw a solution that was guaranteed O(n) time so I wanted to try 
implementing it.
